/**
 * SECTION:element-realsensesrc
 *
 * Source element for Intel RealSense camera. This source takes the 
 * frame_set from the RealSense SDK and multiplexes it into a single buffer
 * that is pushed out on the source pad. Downstream elements may receive this buffer
 * and demux it themselves (use RSMux::demux) or use the rsdemux element to split
 * the color and depth into separate buffers.
 *
 * Example launch line
 * |[
 * gst-launch-1.0 -v -m realsensesrc ! videoconvert ! autovideosink
 * ]|
 * 
 * The example pipeline will display muxed data, so the depth and IMU data 
 * will not be displayed correctly. See rsdemux element to split the sources
 * into seperate streams.
 *
